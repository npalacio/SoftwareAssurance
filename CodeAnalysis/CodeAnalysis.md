# Code Review
## Strategy
Our code review strategy was to follow a scenario based and risk based hybrid approach. Some challenges we were up against included the fact that the Elasticsearch codebase is quite large so trying to analyze everything is not realistic. Another challenge was that most of our team does not have a lot of experience working in large Java projects/repositories. In order to address these challenges we decided to focus our efforts on very specific areas of the Elasticsearch codebase. Specifically, we decided to focus on the **node discovery** and **authentication** parts of Elasticsearch. These areas were deemed high risk based on our findings from scenarios in previous assignments.
