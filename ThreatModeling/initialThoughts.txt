Our Scenarios from use/misuse cases:
-employee logging in
-employee viewing customer account info
-employee updating customer account info
-employee viewing logs on customer's account

Our Assurance cases:
-ES authentication feature
-Information disclosed during ES communication
    -includes node to node communication and cluster to client communication
-audit/security logging
-ES responding to user requests in timely fashion
-ES snapshot and restore feature for disaster recovery

Potential data flow diagrams for assignment:
-web client sending HTTP request to view a customer's account information
-web client sending HTTP request to update a customer's account information
    -I think the difference between this one and just viewing a customer's account information would be this one could involve replicating the data update across nodes in the ES cluster. I think the nodes would be separate processes.
