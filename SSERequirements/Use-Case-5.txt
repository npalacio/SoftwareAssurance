Use Case #5

**Use Case:** Transactional Log of Transaction History

**Description:** The use case is for a log of all transactions historically that happen in the banks system. This log would include all deposits, withdrawals, transfers, etc. This use case would use ElasticSearch for both sides of the transactions. The use case includes IP filtering as a countermeasure to all tampering with logs. In addition, another use case would be encrypted logs with no ability to remove log entries. 

**Misuse Case:** The misuse cases that would threaten the transactional log would be a hacker deleting the log of transactions, and/or inserting in fake log records.
