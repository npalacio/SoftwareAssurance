# Project Description

## What is it?
Elasticsearch is an open-source project that functions as a search engine that allows you to store/organize raw data, search for keywords and tags, and analyze this data relatively quickly. Elasticsearch also scales to the larger extremes and is therefore useful in nearly any application or setting that requires storing and retrieving large amounts of information.

The backend componenents of Elasticsearch is made up of nodes, clusters, indexes, document, shards, and replicas. A node represents a single server and is a unit of a cluster, it stores data and has a universal identifier. Clusters allow searching and indexing. 

Documents are the basic units that are indexed in elastic search, and are collected in an index. Indexes can also be divided into multiple shards, each acting as their own index, this also allows for multiple copies of the same document.

## Contributors
Anyone can contribute to Elasticsearch, and the project is managed by Elastic. There are 1,517 contributers at this moment, and there are daily commits.

## Activity/Use
Elastic's website lists uses of Elasticsearch such as application search, website search, enterprise search, logging and log analytics, infrastructure metrics and container monitoring, application performance monitoring, geospatial data analysis and visualization, security analytics, and business analytics.

Elasticsearch works by taking raw data from different sources and parsing it to be usable before creating indexes. From here the data can be searched through and analyzed.

Elasticsearch can also be used in tandem with a separate group of applications in a package called Elastic Stack, which is a combination of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logtash. This allows for storing, formatting, searching, analyzing, and visualizing almost any data.

## Popularity
Elasticsearch seems to have gained mild popularity, as reportedly Uber is one large company that uses it. Other reported companies are Udemy, Shopify, Slack, etc.

## Languages Used
The languages supported by Elasticsearch are Java, JavaScript, Go, .NET, PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby. 

## Platform
Can be deployed through AWS, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, or through a local system or cloud.
