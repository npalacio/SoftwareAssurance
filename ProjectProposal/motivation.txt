The primary motivation for choosing ElasticSearch as the subject of our project is a combination of the group member's familiarity with the product and the product's
interesting features.

Our team members have utilized this product at work or if not they have utilized Lucene, the open-source search engine software library upon which ElasticSearch is 
based. ElasticSearch is the most popular enterprise search engine today, which makes sense given the high quality of its search engine, HTTP Web interface, and 
scheme-free JSON documents (which is itself an attractive feature to some members on the team who prefer document style data to flat table, schema based models.)
ElasticSearch is a beautiful work of open-source engineering that features the ability to conduct near real-time search while intelligently distributing indices into
shards with each shard having zero or more replicas. This model helps to support automatic rebalancing and routing, which in turn support Elasticsearch's performance, scalability
and reliabilty. With all this, it is no wonder that it has such prominent users like Google, Alibaba, AWS, and the European Union.

While all this alone makes Elasticsearch worth learning about, it is especially relevant for our class for the following reason: major use cases for Elasticsearch include security
analytics, business analytics, application performance mointoring and infrastructure metrics and container monitoring. All of these are either directly or indirectly relevant to the
scope and ethos of our course. It will be our collective pleasure to explore this wonderful product!
