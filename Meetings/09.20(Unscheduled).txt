Agenda:
-figure out GitHub setup
    -use of issues/boards
-break down assignment into tasks
-look at fleshing out our scenario

Notes:
-Github setup
    -tasks will be broken out into issues, issues can be on our board as tasks and assigned to people and referenced in commits/PRs
-proposed adding to our scenario
    -it is a web app for customer support at the bank
    -they take phone calls from customers asking about their account information, need to be able to quickly look up information
    -customers also wish to update their account information via customer support employee
    -only a subset of employees have permissions to update account information
-brainstorm proposed system interactions
    -employee needs to login to web application
        -hacker (identity thief) might impersonate employee in order to login by sending them a phishing email in order to steal their credentials
            -could implement 2FA
        -hacker (identity thief) might impersonate employee in order to login by brute forcing their credentials
            -could implement failed login policy to limit # of failed login attempts
        -hacker can be anyone just trying to steal someone's bank information to get their money

        -hacker (identity thief) might eavesdrop on the network in order to listen to communication between Elasticsearch nodes and steal a customer's account information
            -Elasticsearch implements TLS communcation between nodes in cluster
    -employee needs to updating a customer's account information
        -hacker might call in and impersonate a customer in order to update their account information to falsify the information
        -disgruntled customer support employee might use their credentials to login and update a customer's account information to falsify the information
            -Elasticsearch implements security logging so there is traceability to see who is using the system
            -Elasticsearch implements role based access control so that only users with elevated permissions can update a customer's account information
    -employee needs to create a new bank account for a customer
    -employee needs to delete/cancel an account for a customer
    -employee needs to transfer funds for a customer
